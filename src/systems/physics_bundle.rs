/// To use the `Phythyst` crate is necessary to register the `PhysicsBundle` as show below.
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use amethyst::phythyst::PhysicsBundle;
/// use amethyst::amethyst_nphysics::NPhysicsBackend;
///
/// let game_data = GameDataBuilder::default()
///     .with_bundle(PhysicsBundle::<f32, NPhysicsBackend>::new()).unwrap()
///
/// ```
/// Is it possible to define the Physics Engine floating point precision and the [PhysicsBackend](./trait.PhysicsBackend.html);
/// additionally, the physics frame rate can be specified using the function `with_frames_per_seconds`.
///
/// # Dispatcher pipeline
///
/// ##### Behind the scenes
/// To have a stable execution, the physics stepping is executed with a constant frame rate;
/// and to be frame rate agnostic it keep tracks of the elapsed time.
/// **But don't worry**, the above statement means that a physics step can occur multiple times per
/// each frame.
/// So, when you have a `System` that interact with the physics, you have to register it using
/// the API provided by the `PhysicsBundle`; `Phythyst` will take care to execute your `System`s
/// at the right time.
///
/// ##### Pipeline
/// The physics pipeline is composed by three sections:
/// - **Pre physics** `with_pre_physics`
///
///     Executed just before any physics step. In this section of the pipeline you want to register
///     any `System` that will alter the simulation (like add a force or change a transform).
///
/// - **In physics** `with_in_physics`
///
///     The `System`s in this stage are executed in parallel with the physics stepping, and this section
///     is meant for all the `System`s that have to be executed each physics frame but doesn't depend
///     on its state.
///
/// - **Post physics** `with_post_physics`
///
///     The last section of the physics pipeline, is simply executed just after the physics stepping.
///     In this section, you want to register the `System`s that collects the physics states,
///     (like checking for volumes overlaps, or collision events).
///
/// # Parallel physics dispatching
/// `Phythyst` is designed to dispatch the physics in parallel with everything else, by default.
/// When you start to interact with it, you have to approach it correctly to maintain this property.
///
/// Some internal parts are being explained, and if the physics of your game is not so heavy, or you
/// are not yet confortable with `phythyst`, you can just skip this section.
///
/// The physics pipeline, just explained above, groups all the `System`s that interact with the physics.
/// We can consider all these `System`s, a single group; let's call it `PhysicsBatch`.
///
/// Like any other `System` in `Amethyst`, the `PhysicsBatch` is dispatched by `shred`, this mean that
/// if we make sure that its resources are not used by any other `System`, registered after it, them will
/// run in parallel.
///
/// ##### Synchronization
/// The main concept is easy, but let's see what it mean in practice.
///
/// When nothing is registered in the `PhysicsBatch`, the only resource that can potentially cause problems
/// is the [Transform Component].
/// To avoid using the [Transform Component] inside the `PhysicsBatch`; `Phythyst` defines the
/// `PhysicsSyncSystem`, that executed at the begining of each frame, it will take care to copy the
/// transforms from the physics to `Amethyst`. Leaving the physics and the rendering untied and free
/// to be executed in parallel.
///
/// The dispatcher looks like this:
/// ```ignore
/// |--Sync--||-------------PhysicsBatch------------|
///           |--Any other System--||-- Rendering --|
/// ```
///
/// Taking as example a race game, you may want to display a scratch on the car when it hits something.
/// To ensure that the physics runs in parallel, you want to register the `System` that checks for the
/// collision, before the `PhysicsBatch` (similarly as was explained above).
///
/// The dispatcher looks like this:
/// ```ignore
/// |--Sync--|         |-------------PhysicsBatch------------|
/// |--CollisionSync--||--Any other System--||-- Rendering --|
/// ```
///
/// That's it.
///
/// Following this small trick, the physics will run in parallel with anything else!.
///
/// ## Small TODO to highlight
/// I'm confident that this section will be removed ASAP, but for the sake of completeness I've to
/// mention a problem.
///
/// The above section, which explains how to make the physics runs in parallel, due to a small
/// Amethyst's design problem, is lying.
/// Indeed, is not possible to run the physics and the rendering in parallel, because they
/// are in two different pipelines.
///
/// So the dispatcher looks like:
/// ```ignore
/// |--Sync--|         |-------------PhysicsBatch------------|
/// |--CollisionSync--||--Any other System--|
///                                                            |-- Rendering --|
/// ```
///
/// To know more about it, check this: [https://github.com/AndreaCatania/amethyst/issues/2](https://github.com/AndreaCatania/amethyst/issues/2)
///
/// However, I'm confident that this will be solved soon, and for this reason the above section is
/// written as if this problem doesn't exist.
